 * Thanks to the immutability of Strings in Java, the JVM can optimize the amount 
 * of memory allocated for them by storing only one copy of each literal String in
 * the pool. This process is called interning.
 * In general, we should use the String literal notation when possible. It is 
 * easier to read and it gives the compiler a chance to optimize our code.
 * Before Java 7, the JVM placed the Java String Pool in the PermGen space, which has a 
 * fixed size â€” it can't be expanded at runtime and is not eligible for garbage collection.
 * The risk of interning Strings in the PermGen (instead of the Heap) is that we can get an 
 * OutOfMemory error from the JVM if we intern too many Strings. From Java 7 onwards, the 
 * Java String Pool is stored in the Heap space, which is garbage collected by the JVM. 
 * The advantage of this approach is the reduced risk of OutOfMemory error because 
 * unreferenced Strings will be removed from the pool, thereby releasing memory.
